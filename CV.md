Saeid Amiri has experiences of working in academia and collaborating with non-academic partners. Like many research workers in Statistics, I have been working on different projects related to biostatistics, economy, and ecology. I believe statistics lies at the core of modern applied science, so I would like to define statistics as "The science of doing another sciences". I enjoy programing, and possess expertise in many statistical software, including R, SAS, SPSS, and Eviews. I have experience working with high throughput computing (HTC) to run big projects, and experience with a variety tools and languages, including writing programs in Bash, VBA for Excel, JavaScript, and Python.
